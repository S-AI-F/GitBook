If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

Now we can start version-conrolling files and do initial commits. setwd(new_repo) # First we have to specify our identity shell(&#39;git config --global user.name &quot;Saif Shabou&quot;&#39;) shell(&#39;git config --global user.email &quot;saif.shabou@gmail.com&quot;&#39;) print(getwd()) ## [1] &quot;D:/git_test/Git_Book/MyRepo&quot; # then we create a new file and commit this action nb = sample(1:1000, 1, replace=TRUE) filename = paste(&quot;file_&quot;,nb,&quot;.csv&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;) file.create(filename) ## [1] TRUE cmd_add = paste(&quot;git add&quot;, filename, sep = &quot; &quot;) shell(cmd_add) shell(&#39;git commit -m &quot;adding new file&quot;&#39;, intern = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;[master (root-commit) 56d1195] adding new file&quot; ## [2] &quot; 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)&quot; ## [3] &quot; create mode 100644 file_160.csv&quot; 3.1.2 Cloning an existing git project When we want to get a copy of an existing Git repositery we can use git clone shell(&quot;git clone https://github.com/S-AI-F/Remote-sensing-image-analysis MyClone&quot;) ## Warning in shell(&quot;git clone https://github.com/S-AI-F/Remote-sensing-image- ## analysis MyClone&quot;): &#39;git clone https://github.com/S-AI-F/Remote-sensing-image- ## analysis MyClone&#39; execution failed with error code 128 3.2 Recording Changes to the repositery Each file in our working directory can be in one of to possible states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are the files known by Git. They can be: unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are any files in the orking directory that are not in the staging area. When we clone a repository, all the files will be tracked and unmodified. When we are editing files, Git considers them as modified since they changed from the last commit. As we work, we stage these modified files and then we commit all those stages changes. And this cycle repeats. Git lifecycle (source:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) 3.2.1 Checking the Status of Files The command git status enables s to determine the status of the different tracked files. shell(&quot;git status&quot;, intern = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;On branch master&quot; ## [2] &quot;Changes not staged for commit:&quot; ## [3] &quot; (use \\&quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...\\&quot; to update what will be committed)&quot; ## [4] &quot; (use \\&quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...\\&quot; to discard changes in working directory)&quot; ## [5] &quot; (commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)&quot; ## [6] &quot;\\tmodified: .Rproj.user/CE830DEF/sources/prop/72E6F1F2&quot; ## [7] &quot;\\tmodified: 02-gitBasics.Rmd&quot; ## [8] &quot;\\tmodified: Git_Book.Rmd&quot; ## [9] &quot;\\tmodified: MyRepo (new commits)&quot; ## [10] &quot;\\tmodified: _book (modified content, untracked content)&quot; ## [11] &quot;&quot; ## [12] &quot;no changes added to commit (use \\&quot;git add\\&quot; and/or \\&quot;git commit -a\\&quot;)&quot; We have to check the file status to know if we need to make a new commit. When the message tells:Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. nothing to commit, working directory clean, it means that none of our tracked files are modified. 3.2.2 Tracking new Files In order to track new file, we can use the command git add. To track all the existing files in the directory we use git add . In the git status results, we can see that Git recognizes the changes to be committed shell(&quot;git add .&quot;, intern = TRUE) ## character(0) We can use the command git diff to know what files we changed but not yet staged and what files we staged but not yet commited. shell(&quot;git diff&quot;, intern = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;diff --git a/_book b/_book&quot; ## [2] &quot;--- a/_book&quot; ## [3] &quot;+++ b/_book&quot; ## [4] &quot;@@ -1 +1 @@&quot; ## [5] &quot;-Subproject commit 60541b3b2f3d9da446b35180ab82562e3a748416&quot; ## [6] &quot;+Subproject commit 60541b3b2f3d9da446b35180ab82562e3a748416-dirty&quot; The command compares what is in our working directory with the staging area. The results show the changes we have made and have not yet staged. 3.2.3 Committing changes Committing changes include only files created and modified that are added using git add command. We have to check git status before committing in order to check that files to commit are already staged. shell(&#39;git commit -m &quot;my message of comit&quot;&#39;, intern = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;[master 677618a] my message of comit&quot; ## [2] &quot; 4 files changed, 21 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)&quot; "],

To avoid arrors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitingore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub 2- Open Git Bash 3- Chan the current working directory to your local project setwd(dir = &quot;D:/git_test/Git_Book/_book&quot;) 4- Initialize the local directory as a Git repository shell(&quot;git init&quot;) 5- Ad the files in your new local repositor. This stages them for the first commit shell(&quot;git add .&quot;) ## Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use &#39;git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE&#39;. 6- Commit the files that you have staged in your local repository shell(&#39;git commit -m &quot;My First commit&quot;&#39;,intern = TRUE) ## Warning in system(cmd, intern = intern, wait = wait | intern, ## show.output.on.console = wait, : l&#39;exécution de la commande &#39;C: ## \\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /c git commit -m &quot;My First commit&quot;&#39; renvoie un statut ## 1 ## [1] &quot;On branch master&quot; ## [2] &quot;Changes not staged for commit:&quot; ## [3] &quot; (use \\&quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...\\&quot; to update what will be committed)&quot; ## [4] &quot; (use \\&quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...\\&quot; to discard changes in working directory)&quot; ## [5] &quot; (commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)&quot; ## [6] &quot;\\tmodified: _book (modified content, untracked content)&quot; ## [7] &quot;&quot; ## [8] &quot;no changes added to commit (use \\&quot;git add\\&quot; and/or \\&quot;git commit -a\\&quot;)&quot; ## attr(,&quot;status&quot;) ## [1] 1 # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use &#39;git reset --soft HEAD~1&#39; and commit and add the file again. 7- At the top of your GitHub repository’s Quick setup page, copy the remote repository URL 8- In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed # sets the new remote shell(&#39;git remote add origin https://github.com/S-AI-F/GitBook.git&#39;) ## Warning in shell(&quot;git remote add origin https://github.com/S-AI-F/GitBook.git&quot;): ## &#39;git remote add origin https://github.com/S-AI-F/GitBook.git&#39; execution failed ## with error code 128 # Verifies the new remote URL shell(&#39;git remote -v&#39;, intern = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;origin\\thttps://github.com/S-AI-F/GitBook.git (fetch)&quot; ## [2] &quot;origin\\thttps://github.com/S-AI-F/GitBook.git (push)&quot; 9 - Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub # Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin shell(&#39;git push origin master&#39;) 4.2 Getting changes from a remote repository These commands are very useful when interacting with a remote repository. clone and fetch donload remote code from a repository’s remote URL to your local compter. merge is used to merge different people’s work tohether with yours, and pull is a combination of fetch and merge. 4.2.1 Cloning a repository # Clones a repository to your computer shell(&#39;git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git&#39;) 4.2.2 Fetching changes from a remote repository Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tgs without merging those changes into your own branches. # Fetches updates made to a remote repository shell(&#39;git fetch remotename&#39;) 4.2.3 Merging changes into your local branch Meging combines your local changes with changes made by others. # Merges updates made online with your local work shell(&#39;git merge remotename/branchname&#39;) 4.2.4 Pulling changes from a remote repository git pull is a convenient shortcut for completing both git fetch and git merge in the same command # Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work shell(&#39;git merge remotename branchname&#39;) Because pull performs a merge on the retrieved changes, you should ensure that your local work is committed before running the pull command. If you run into a merge conflict you cannot resolve, or if you decide to quit the merge, you can use git merge --abort to take the branch back to where it was before you pulled. "],
